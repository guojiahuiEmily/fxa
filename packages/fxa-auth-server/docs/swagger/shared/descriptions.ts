    The type of grant flow being used. If not specified, it will default to fxa-credentials unless a code parameter is provided, in which case it will default to authorization_code. The value of this parameter determines which other parameters will be expected in the request body, as follows:
    - When \`grant_type=authorization_code\`:
      - \`code\`:  *validators.authorizationCode, required* The authorization code previously obtained through a redirect-based OAuth flow.
      - \`code_verifier\`: *validators.pkceCodeVerifier, optional* The [**PKCE**](https://github.com/mozilla/fxa/blob/main/packages/fxa-auth-server/fxa-oauth-server/docs/pkce.md) code verifier used when obtaining code. This is required for public OAuth clients, who must authenticate their authorization code use via PKCE.
      - \`redirect_uri\`: *string, URI, optional* The URI at which the client received the authorization code. If supplied this must match the value provided during OAuth client registration.
    - When \`grant_type=refresh_token\`:
      - \`refresh_token\`: *validators.refreshToken, required* A refresh token, as issued by a previous call to this endpoint.
      - \`scope\`: *string, optional* A space-separated list of scope values that will be held by the generated token. These must be a subset of the scopes originally granted when the refresh token was generated.
    - When \`grant_type=fxa-credentials\`:
      - \`scope\`: *string, optional* A space-separated list of scope values that will be held by the generated tokens.
      - \`access_type\`: *string, valid(online, offline), optional* If specified, a value of offline will cause the client to be granted a refresh token alongside its access token.
    -In addition, the request must be authenticated with a sessionToken.
